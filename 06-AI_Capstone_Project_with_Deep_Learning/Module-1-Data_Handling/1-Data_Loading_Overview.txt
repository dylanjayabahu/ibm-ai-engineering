Bulk Loading = Loads entire dataset into RAM at once.

    Advantage: Very fast repeated access (no repeated disk I/O).
    Disadvantage: Extremely memory heavy → scales poorly for large datasets.

    Practical only for small-scale or research use cases.

Sequential (Lazy) Loading = Loads only current batch from disk on demand.

    Advantage: 
        Very memory efficient → scalable to huge datasets.
        No long initial loading phase → can start training quickly.

    Disadvantage:
        Slower due to repeated disk I/O.
        Can cause GPU idle time (I/O bottleneck).
        
        Mitigation: parallel data loading (used in PyTorch, Keras, etc.).




Bulk Loading → Fast access but not scalable.
Sequential Loading → Scalable and memory-efficient but can be slow (fixed with parallel I/O).
