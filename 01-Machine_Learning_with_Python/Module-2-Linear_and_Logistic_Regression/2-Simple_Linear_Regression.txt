Linear Regression:
    models linear relationship b/w continuous target variable and explanatory features 

    Simple linear regression: single feature variable (X) estimates the dependent variable (y)

        y_hat = a + bx_1

        residual error: vert distance b/w regression line and actual point (|yhat - y|)
        
        can also use MSE = avg [(yhat-y)^2]

        ordinary least squares (OLS) regression:
            find the line that minimizes average residual error

            can calculate with xbar, ybar
                ybar = avg(y)
                xbar = avg(x)
            
            b = sum [ (xbar - xi)(ybar - yi) ] / sum [ (xi-xbar)^2]
            a = ybar - b*xbar

        linear regression finds line which minimizes MSE/OLS

        prediction is just plugging x in and finding y; 
            hence OLS is fast, but could be far too simplistic
