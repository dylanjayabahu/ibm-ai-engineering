Given a data matrix x and a class vector y, 
    row i of data matrix correponds to element i of class vector 
    for categorical data y can contain only discrete values representing diff classes

    u can plot points and color code them by class label for data visualization purposes 

Binary linear classifier:
    z = wx + b

    or wx when we add the 1 in the x vector to encompas the bias term as well 
    
    generalizes to higher dims when w and x are vectors 

    if z > 0, predict class 0 
    else predict class 1
    ^ threshold function

    that is, the line/plane/hyperplane is now trying to separate the data, not fit it 
    data is linearly separable if it can be separated by a line/plane/hyperplane 


Logistic regression: 
    instead of threshold function, use the sigmoid function 

    sigmoid(z) = 1/(1+e^(-z))

    better performance than threshold function; outputs continuous probabilties 

    use a threshold value between 0-1, usually 0.5
