Tensors: data structure that is a generalization for numbers/dimensional arrays in python 
    e.g. an array of scalors is a vector, an array of vectors is a matrix, etc. the general term is a tensor
    scalar is a rank 0 tensor
    vector is a rank 1 tensor
    matrix is a rank 2 tensor 
    stack of matrices is a rank 3 tensor 
    batch of images w/ rgb is a rank 4 tensor

Neural nets are composed of tensors
    hence 'tensor'flow 
    nns in pytorch are made of pytorch tensors

Operations on tensors are extentions of vector and matrix Operations

Convert data to pytorch tensors so that it can be fed into a nn 
    ez to turn np arrays into pytorch tensors and vice versa
    hence pytorch can work with the rest of python ecosystem very well
