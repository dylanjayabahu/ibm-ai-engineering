Dataset
    n points of (x, y)
    correspodning x and y values are marked with same subscript, x_i, y_i 
    in simple linear regression x is a single value; later we will see X as a vector of feature values 

Noise assumption 
    we assume gaussian noise in linear regression 
    there will always be noise regardless of the model in real world data

    higher stdev means more deviatino from line 

Training linear regression  = finding line that fits the best 
    use MSE as cost function 
    best fitting line minimizes MSE
