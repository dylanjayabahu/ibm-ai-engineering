AI = simulating cognitive abilities of humans
AI includes
    - Computer Vision (CV)
    - Natural language processing (NLP)
    - Generative Ai
    - Machine Learning (ML)
        - Deep learning 

ML:
    subset of AI 
    uses algos
    requires feature engineering 

    DL:
        subset of ML 
        uses multi layered neural networks 
        automatically extracts features from large data     

    lets computers learn, identify patterns, make decisions

    algos use computational methods for learning (no fixed algo)



ML Paradigms
    Supervised learning: train on labelled data to be applied to new data
    Unsupervised learning: train on unlabelled data; finds patterns in the data
    Semisupervised learning: small subset of data is already labelled; add new labels that it makes with high confidence iteratively 
    Reinforcement learning: simulates an agent interacting with env and learns from feedback


ML Techniques 
    Classification: predicts classor category of a case 
    Regression: estimates/predicts continuous values 
    Clustering: grouping similar data (e.g. customer segmentation)
    Association: find items or events that co-occur 
    Anomoly detection: discovers unusual or abnormal cases (e.g. fraud detection)
    Sequnce mining: predict the next event (e.g. markov chain)
    Dimension reducing: reduce data size; reduce num features 
    Recommendation sytems: associates ppls preferences with others and recommends new items


ML model lifecycle
    - problem definition
    - data collection
    - data preparation
        exploratory data analysis
        data partitioning
    - model development and evaluation
        use existing frameworks
    - model deployment


    ETL = extract, transform, load
        (collect data from various sources then prep and clean and store as ds)


ML Libraries: pandas, skicit learn 
ML Languages: python, r, 
    also julia, scala, java, js 


Tools for ml
    Data prep/wrangling:
        pandas - data frames/data wrangling
        numpy - efficient numerical computation on arrs
        (also PostgreSQL Hadoop spark r-ggplot2 outside of python)

    Data vis:
        Matplotlib - customizable plots/interactive visualization
        Seaborn - statistical graphics 

    ML:
        scipy (built on numpy)
        scikit learn - classical ml models

    DL:
        tensorflow
        keras 
        pytorch 
        theano

    CV:
        OpenCV 
        skikit-image (built on scipy)
        torchvision 

    NLP:
        NLTK 
        textblob
        stanza

    Gen AI:
        hugging face transformers
