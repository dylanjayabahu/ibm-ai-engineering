DBSCAN = Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
HDBSCAN = Heirarchical DBSCAN


DBSCAN
    - density based clustering algo
    - clusters centered around spacial centroids 
    - provide density value 
    - goal is to define neighbourhood clusters with specified density 


    can discover clusters of any shape/size/density 
    distinguishes data that is part of cluster vs noise 
    useful when num clusters unknown

centroid (partition) based vs density based
    - centroid based   
        finds convex clusters 
        assigns every point to a cluster even when it doesnt fit well 
    
    - density based 
        addresses more complex clusters and noise 
        identifies connected regions of high density



DBSCAN algo:
    select N, epsilon
        N is minimum num points in a neighbourhood 
        epsilon is the radius of each neihgbourhood

    
    for every point in ds, label as:
        core point if there are N-1 points within dist epsilon of it (there are N points in the epsilon neighbourhood)
        border point if is within a neighbourhood, but is not a core point itself 
        noise point if its not in any epsilon neighbourhood
    
        clusters are the core points and their neighbourhoods

not iterative; one pass 
any unassigned points remaining are considered noise 


HDBSCAN 
    variant of DB scan that doesnt require u to set N and epsilon 
    less sensitive to noise and outliers 


    cluster stability: cluster persistance over a range of reasonable epislon values
    HDBSCAN locally adjusts epsilon for cluster stability 
    imporves culstering for variable-density and noisy data

    algo:
        combine agglomerative and density based clustering 

        start with each point as its own cluster (noise)
        progressively agglomerates clusters into a hierarchy 

        ^ this creates a heirarchical tree, which gets simplified to a condensed tree with the stable clusters
