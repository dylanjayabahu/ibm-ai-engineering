Classification:
    - supervised ml method 
    - use trained models to predict labels on new data
    - labels are a categorical variable with discrete values 


Supervised Learning:
    - understand data in context when answering question 
        ensures accuracy 
    - model adjusts data to fit into algorithm and classifies it 

Applications of classification 
    can be used anywhere there is a mapping of feature and target variables; target is discrete
    e.g. email filtering, speech to text, handwriting recognition, biometrics, document classification, 
    churn prediction, customer segmentation, advertising (respond/not)


Classifiation Algos 
    - naive bayes 
    - logistic regresion 
    - decision trees
    - knn 
    - support vector machines 
    - neural networks 

Multiclass prediction 
    - cant be done by certain algos that only work for binary  (e.g. logistic regression)
        ^ can still use these algos as components

        1 verse all:
            a binary classifier for each class 

        1 verse 1:
            consider all possible pairs of classes 
            have a binary classifier for each pair 
            final decision made by voting scheme (class predicted by most wins)

            to avoid ties use better schemes; e.g. weight votes by confidence
