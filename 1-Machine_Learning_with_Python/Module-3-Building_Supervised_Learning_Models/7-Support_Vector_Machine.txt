SVM = support vector machine 
    supervised learning 
    for classification or regression 

    each data is a point in multidimentional space 
    SVM finds the hyperplane separating the data into groups 
        goal is to find the largest margin; this will make it do better on test data
    

    can use a soft margin as data is noisy and cannot be perfectly separated
        soft margin allows for a larger margin too
        
        but large margin also means more misclassifications 

        need to balance between high margin and minimizing misclassifications 
            controlled by parameter c 

            smaller c allows more misclassifications (softer/larger margin)
            higher c forces strict separation (harder margin)
        
    
Binary SVMs
    assumes the two classes are linearly separable
        by finding a decision boundary; the hyperplane that maximizes the margin 
        margin is dist b/w plane and nearest points <== the suppor vectors 
    can also be adapted to solve regression problems 


    if the classes are not linearly separable, it wont work in 2d 
        so we extend to 3d with parabolic 3d embedding, so the classes can clearly be speparated by a horizontal plane

        this is called Kernelling 
            Kernelling = mapping data to a higher dimensional space 

        Kernel functions for SVM in skicit learn 
            linear (default)
            polynomial 
            RBF = radial basis functions 
            sigmoid 

Extending to regression 
    if u have an SVR (support vector regression), 
    then u can define a distance, epsilon, around which it is considered signal 
    and if outside that margin its considered noise


SVM pros and cons 
    pros;
        effective in high dimentional data 
        robust to overfitting
        works well on linearly separable data 
        works well with weakly separable data 

    limitations:
        slow on large training sets 
        sensitive to noise and overlapping classes 
        relies on kernel and regularization parameters chosen
