momentum
    solves
        - parameters stuck at saddle points
        - getting stuck in local minima 

Quick physics momentum recap / analogy 
    moment = mv 

    position is like the value of the weight; it gets updated each time based on velocity (times dt)
        we will assume 1 step is 1 unit of time
    

    acceleration is like the partial_derivative term of backprop 

    velocity is what will update the weight 
    v2 = v1 + a* delta_t

    since accel is partial deriv, and we assume 1 step is 1 dt 

    v2 = p * v1 + d(loss)/d(weight)
        p (ro) is the momentum term 
        positive value 
        usually less than 1

        momentum of 1 


    just as in physics, we update position based on velocity 

    w_new = w_old + eta * v2 
        eta is learning rate 
        v2 is new velocity we just calculated 


    initially, weight (position) is randomized based on weight init from prev lesson 
    velocity is set to 0 initially (stationary ball, for example)
    acceleration is calculated based on loss (just like acceleration would be calculated based on a force)

    as the iterations go, the velocity will be updated by accel, and the position (weight paramter) will be updated by the velocity

    small ro means its like a light ball; the force (impulse) applied will move its velocity a lot 
    large ro means its like a heavy ball; the force(impulse) has less of an effect on its velocity



Saddle Points: 
    a flat point on the loss surface; gets worst and worst in higher dimensions 
    if u follow the loss landscape wrt a weight, we may come to a saddle point along the curve

    the derivative of this saddle point is 0 (or close to 0), so the weight wont be adjusted much anymore 

    if we have momentum, the momentum will allow the ball to get through the saddle point   
        that is, the weight will get passed the saddle point and continue to be updated towards lower loss
        essentially, we can maintain a nonzero velocity even when the gradient is 0 

Local Minima 
    if we converge to a local minmum on the loss surface, momentum can help us roll up over so that we can find the global minimum 

    if the momentum term is too small, it will still get caught in local minima
        the ball doesnt have enough momentum to make it over the hump 

    if momenum is too large we may overshoot global minimum; like a ball that never losses any eneger and just keeps rolling around without stopping
