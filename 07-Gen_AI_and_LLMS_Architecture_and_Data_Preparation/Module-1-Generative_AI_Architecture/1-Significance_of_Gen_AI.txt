Gen Ai = = Generative AI = deep learning models that can generate high quality images/test/etc based on what they were trained on 
    understand patterns and structures in existing data; apply that to make new/relevant data 

Types of models 
    can make diff types of content (text/image/audio/3d objects/music)

    text generation models  
        find relationship b/w words and phrases and generate rest of a phrase
        or translating b/w languages 
            
            e.g. GPT 
    
    image generation models 
        generate image from text input 
            e.g. DALL-E
        or generate/modify image from image seed image/random input
            see diffusion models lesson from Course 03 module 4
            also GAN
        or from sketches 

    
    audio generation 
        e.g. wavenet 

Gen ai applications 
    healthcare - e.g. process image of test result and generate a patient report 
    finance - e.g. make predictions and forecasts from massive datasets 
    gaming - e.g. interactive elements/storylines developed with AI
