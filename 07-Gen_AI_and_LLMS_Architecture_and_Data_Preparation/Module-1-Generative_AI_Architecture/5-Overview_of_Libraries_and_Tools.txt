Pytorch, tensorflow, huggingface, langchain, pydantic 


Pytorch 
    made by meta

    highly customizable 
    used a openai and tesla

    dynamic computation graphs (autograd)

    rich ecosystem/community 
        e.g. torchvision torchtext 

    favored in research; adaptable env for experimenting/prototyping


Tensorflow 
    made by google 
    built on keras

    scalable => turn reserach prototypes into production 

    tensorflow extended (tfx)
        also tflite, tf.js etc. etc.

    keras integration 
        lets u rapidly prototype in tensorflow with tf.keras 
    
    large scale => preferred for enterprise-level NLP 
    

Hugging Face 
    offers open source library w/ pretrained moels 
    lets u streamline training/fine tuning of gen ai models 

    extensive model repository 
         mostly focused on NLP, easily shareable/discover/use models
         supports models in popular frameworks (tensorflow/pytorch)

    simple 
        user friendly, accesible to all 
    
    community 


    useful huggingface libraries 
        Transformers library 
        Datasets library 
        Tokenizers library 

LangChain
    streamline AI app dev with LLMs 

    Advanced prompt engineering 
    Seamless integration with leading models (e.g. GPT, chatgpt)

    NLP application; chatbots ez to integrate

Pydantic 
    streamlines data handling 
    robust data validation; reliable 
    manage settings easily
