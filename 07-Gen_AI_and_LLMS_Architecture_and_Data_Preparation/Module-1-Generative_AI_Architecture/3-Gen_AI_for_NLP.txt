Gen AI Goals 
    comprehend human language 
    generate indistinguishable responses human vs ai

    done by 
        context awareness
        coherent interactions 
        predictive analytics
        advanced modelling 
    
    sense feelings 
    grasp intention of words, more understanding 


Evolution of genai for nlp 
    rule based systems 
        predefined linguisting rules, very limited
    ml based approach 
        statistical methods from data but still limited 
    dl architectures 
        dl on large data, big breakthrough
    traformer 
        specifically designed for sequential data, perfect for nlp
        latest improvement 

NLP specific uses 
    machine translation 
        context aware convos
    chatbot convos 
        human lake/natural convos
    sentiment analysis 
        subtle language expressions
    text summarization
        recognize core meaning



Language Models 
    LLM = large language model 
        use aAI and DL with vast datasets 
            DL because involves datasets on the order of petabytes, with billions of parameters 

            allows them to 
                - understand lang structs and contexts 
                - capture nuance of human lang 
                - have more natural interaction 
                - predict next word 
                - creative content with minimal domain-specific 
            
        examples 
            GPT
                acts as a decoder; predicts next word 
                good at making text 
                used for chatbots
            
            BERT 
                encoder only transformer 
                understands context of word in sentence 
                used in sentiment analysis and question answer 


            Bart and T5
                use encoder-decoder arch 
                versatile for various NLP tasks
    
    Most llms based on transformer 
        very versatile, can be trained for generic then fine tune on much smaller ds 
    
    May generature confidently incorrect info; learn bias from training data
