tensorflow 
    opensource platform for ml 
    developed by google 

    deploy models across various envs, from serves to edge devices



key features of tensorflow 2.x 
    eager execution 
        - allows operations to be executed immediately without building graphs
        - improved debugging, simplified code, 
        - before u hat to define a graph then run session, now runs like normal python code
    intuitive high level APIs
        integrates keras; modular and composable
    support for various platofmrs and devices (mobile, web,etc)
    scalability and performance     
        works across cpu/gpu etc
    rich ecosystem 
        tensorflow lite, tflite: lightweight solution, can deploy on mobiles and edge devices; ow latency and high performance inference 
        tensorflow.js: deploy ml models injavascript, lets u use web apps 
        tensorflow extended, tfx: deploy production ml pipelines, can monitor and manage
        tensorflow hub: repo of resuable ml modules
        tensorboard: visualization toolkit during training
