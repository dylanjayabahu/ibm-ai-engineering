Single neuron is a perceptron 
    neuron is fundamental unit in artificial neural networks 
    multiple neurons combined in layers to make a nn

input layer and output layer of neurons 
hidden in between 

forward prop:
    how data flows from input to output 

    input neurons' values are multiplied by weights and then summed 
        (the dot product of the weigths and the neuron values)
    final bias term is added => this is the linear combination of the inputs, which we will call z 
    activation function is applied 
    this gives the new value of the current neuron, which we will a
        a = f(z), f is the activation function 
    
    activation function:
        a neural net without activation functions is just a chunky linear regression model
