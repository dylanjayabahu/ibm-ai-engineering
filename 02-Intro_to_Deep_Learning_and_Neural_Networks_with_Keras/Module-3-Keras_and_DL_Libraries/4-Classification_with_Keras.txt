Need to one hot encode categorical data so network can predict it 
    => turn into an array with binary values, with a 1 in the spot of the label
    can be done with keras to_categorical function 

    rest is the same 

    softmax is good for classification final activation

    use cateogrical crossentropy loss instead of MSE for classification 

    can also monitor metrics (like accuracy) that are appicable to classification 
        specified when u do model.compile, provide a list to the metrics arg
