RNN = recurrent neural networks 

typical nn assumes input data points are independant instances 
    not suited for things like video analysis (frames depend on each other)
    or text inputs (words depend on each other)

Rnns solve this 
    rnn will Take a new input as well as output from prev data point 

    good at modelling patterns and sequences of data 
        text 
        genomes 
        handwriting 
        stock markets 
    
    take time and sequence into account (temporal dimension)


LSTM model 
    = long short term memory model 
    popular example of rnn 

    used for 
        image generation 
        handwriting generation 
        captioning images and videos
