Shallow vs Deep:
    shallow = 1-2 hidden layers 
    deep = >3 hidden layers, large # neurons in layers

    shallow can only take vector inputs 
    deep can take raw data like images and text and extract features (e.g. CNN)


Why DL took off:
    1. advancement in field
        e.g. relu overcoming vanishing gradient
    2. data
        more data, more available data
        conventional ml algos only improve up to a point with more data 
        deep learning keeps improving with more data 
    3. computational power increases
        better GPUs
        can train and experiment faster than before
