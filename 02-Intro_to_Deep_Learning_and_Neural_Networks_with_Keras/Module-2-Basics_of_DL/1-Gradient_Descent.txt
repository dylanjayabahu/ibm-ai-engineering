Cost Function 
    e.g. MSE = avg [(y_pred = y_act)^2]
    
    take steps proportional to negative gradient at current point 

    eta, or learning rate, controls how big the step is (scales the gradient)

    step = -eta * d[cost]/d[w]
                    ^ partial derivative of cost function with respect to w
